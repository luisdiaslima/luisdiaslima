### Hi there! 😁 

My name is Luís Felipe Dias Lima from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Front-End Developer since 2020 and currently working in [Luizalabs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/luizalabs). 

In my free time I like to go to the gym (🏋️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I participate in volunteer events (😄).

My technical skills include proficiency in several technologies, with a focus on Vue.js, React.js,
and Node.js, as well as extensive expertise in agile methodologies and web accessibility.

Would you like to find me?
